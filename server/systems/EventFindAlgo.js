/*
NOTE: For MVP, let's say that a change in members triggers an event search. Ideally, though, this should be spontaneous
Step 1: On event search trigger, filter events by...
    1) core interest of the group
    2) within certain radius of central location of the group
    3) by event type that is closest or same as that of the group.

    Continue going up interest tree if none????

Step 2: Send invites to all members of the group and have it show up in their events tab
